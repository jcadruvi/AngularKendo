This is a project that I used to show how to use jQuery plugins with AngularJS. This project shows how to use the Kendo UI jQuery plugins with a
Angular directive. This project uses the Kendo combo box and Kendo date picker plugins. Running the project will bring up a simple page that has two
combo boxes and two date pickers as well as a selected values section. Selecting a value from a combo box and date time picker will show the value in
the selected values section. This is to show that two way binding is working correctly. The combo boxes are the kendoComboBox directive and the date 
time pickers are the kendoDatePicker directive. The values displayed in the combo boxes are retrieved from the server via a Rest API in the kendoController.
